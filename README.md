# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The *travelling salesman problem* (also known as the *TSP*) asks, "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest feasible route that visits each city precisely once and returns to the starting city?" It is an *NP-hard* problem.

This repository contains various approaches to solving the *TSP* implemented in *C++*.
