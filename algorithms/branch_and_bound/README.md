# Branch and Bound

In the worst-case scenario, the computational complexity is identical to that of the brute force approach, i.e. *O(n!)*. In fact, however, this strategy works extremely rapidly, although it is dependent on the exact instance of the issue as well as the function used to determine upper and lower bounds. This particular implementation uses recursion.
