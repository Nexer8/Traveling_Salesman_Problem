# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a technique for addressing optimization problems that is based on the search for a decision sequence. This approach computes solutions to all sub-problems, beginning with the most basic. The outcomes of solved sub-problems are preserved in the constructed table, so in the event of running into the same issue again, the algorithm will not have to solve it again. The algorithm has an $O(n^22^n)$ time complexity and an $O(n2^n)$ memory complexity.
