# Brute Force

The concept of brute force is based on examining all conceivable scenarios and then picking the best one. It always yields the proper outcome. This, however, comes at the price of a computational complexity.

## Swap-based Brute Force

This approach used *swap* and recursion. Its computational complexity is *O(n!)*, resulting in an extremely long execution time.

## Tree search Brute Force

Another algorithm that can be used to solve small instances of the traveling salesman problem is the brute force based on the searched tree and recursion. The computational complexity in this case is the same as in the swap example and is *O(n!)*. The algorithm works slowly but guarantees the correct result.
